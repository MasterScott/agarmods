Due to our massive growth and being the only officially recognised mod
for agar.io, we have decided to close our codebase because forks are now
starting to put our project at risk.

It's been fun, the archive will stay in place, but future development will
continue in a more secretive environment.

Thank you to those that have supported us in all of the ways in which
have made us who we are.

Much respect.

P.S. The repo history will remain preserved.
